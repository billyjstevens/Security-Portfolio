Professional Statement


Billy Stevens’ Persona:


Billy is a high school graduate and has also completed the majority of an Information Technology AAS at Vista College, however, Vista College closed down without notice. His greatest subjects in high school were math, science, and writing. He participated as a member of a Robotics team where he led the design and development of a remote controlled robot that could pickup objects and transport them through an obstacle course. He is interested in the security field, and while he has no previous professional experience, he enjoys learning IT and security related skills. He is an avid home-labber and has used this to teach himself practical foundations and skills to combine with his transferable skills (collaborating, blueprint reading, leadership, inspecting, project management, industry codes and regulations, report writing) from his previous career in the oil, gas, energy, and construction field as an independent contractor, specifically, a pipeline welder and pipefitter, site engineer, and completed the schooling and testing necessary to become an associate certified welding inspector with the American Welding Society. Billy wants an entry-level cybersecurity position that will allow him to gain real-world practical experience and utilize his passion for protecting people’s personal information and privacy. He believes the Google Cybersecurity Certificate will make him a better-suited candidate and aid him in developing the professional skills he needs.
